SCONE - a shielded execution framework built on modern Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). 
The main aim of SCONE is to protect the data analytics application and its secrets against strong attackers (attackers with root access) in a transparent manner, i.e., without changing the applicationâ€™s source code. At the end of the talk, we will provide a live demo on how to secure PySpark - a widely used framework for data analytics in industry - using SCONE.
